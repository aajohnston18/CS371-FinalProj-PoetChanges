# PoetTraining
The aim of the application is to train individuals to make images, particularly critical STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) content, accessible to all readers. This module replaces the existing training module currently available at: https://diagram.herokuapp.com/training/index <br />
The module consists of 4 main sections:
* Introduction to Accessible Images
* When to Describe
* How to Describe
* Practice Describing <br />
Please refer to the mockups available at https://benetech.box.com/poettrainingmodule and copy available at https://app.box.com/s/pnz0j4zuqoanatmv1mts4mszzhcciei9<br />
