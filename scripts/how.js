			  		<li>Use context to decide which basic concepts and terms have already been explained, and avoid repetition of explanations.</li> \
			  		<li>Use the following questions to decide which key elements of an image are needed to understand the content: </li> \
			  			<ul> \
			  				<li>Is it part of an introduction for a chapter or lesson? If so, the image probably isn’t teaching a concept and may not need to be described in detail. </li> \
			  				<li>Is it the central point of a lesson? If so, the image is a critical part of the learning concept and should be described as thoroughly as possible. </li> \
			  				<li>Is it purely decorative? If the image does not teach anything, describe it as a decorative image and avoid sharing irrelevant information. </li> \
			  				<li>Is it part of an assessment or activity? If so, be sure to describe the specific pieces of information needed to complete the task. </li> \
			  				<li>Is an action required? When a figure contains additional links or represents an activity (e.g. pencil icon represents a writing exercise, headphone icon represents a listening exercise), highlight the functional role to facilitate navigation. </li> \
